# NativeScript animation demo application
Open source cross-platform animation demo app built with NativeScript.

Use this application to find-out how to implement common animation scenarios with NativeScript.

## Running the sample

2. Install the dependencies of the sample (NativeScript modules and TypeScript compiler) and add the preferred platform-specific tools to the project library. Note that iOS development is only available with a Mac machine.

       `tns install`

3. Compile the TypeScript code

       `node_modules/typescript/bin/tsc -p .`

4. Run the project.
